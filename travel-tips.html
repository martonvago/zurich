            <h3>A Medley of Languages</h3>
            <p>
                Switzerland has four official languages: <span class="gentle-bold">German</span>, <span
                class="gentle-bold">French</span>, <span class="gentle-bold">Italian</span> and <span
                class="gentle-bold">Romansh</span>. Zürich lies in the German speaking part of the country, 
                where people speak <span class="gentle-bold">Swiss German</span>, a German dialect, which 
                differs from region to region. For anyone who speaks or is learning to speak German, this 
                can be tiring because at first it‘s very hard to understand even for people with a German 
                mother tongue. However, a lot of Swiss speak English fairly well, especially the younger 
                generation, so getting by in <span class="gentle-bold">English</span> is generally no
                problem. <a class="source" href="https://www.inyourpocket.com/zurich/basics/Language" target="_blank"

            <h3>Zürich on a Budget</h3>
            <p>
                With sit-down restaurants costing around CHF 40 per meal per person, eating out in Switzerland can be
                very costly, so buy your groceries. A week’s worth of food (bread, pasta, rice, eggs, vegetables,
                cheese, deli meats for sandwiches, and some assorted fruit) will cost you CHF 75–100. The major
                supermarkets are <span class="gentle-bold">Migros</span>, <span class="gentle-bold">COOP</span>, and
                <span class="gentle-bold">Spar</span>. COOP is the most expensive. <a class="source"

            <h3>Lazy Sundays</h3>
            <p>
                Like in a lot of European countries, Sunday is a family day in Switzerland. In Zürich (and in most other
                towns in Switzerland) almost everything is closed on Sunday. But shops and restaurants in train stations
                and airports as well as some museums, cafés and bars will remain open. <a class="source"

            <h3>Staying Connected</h3>
            <p>
                The standard portable system (GSM/GPRS/3G) covers even the mountain regions well. However, Switzerland
                is not a member of the EU, so don't assume low call and data rates. In the event that you plan to remain
                for some time, you should think about obtaining a prepaid card. The markets offer them at very sensible
                costs. The nation code for Switzerland is <span class="gentle-bold">+41</span>, the zone code for Zürich
                is <span class="gentle-bold">44</span>. <a class="source"

            <h3>Seeing a Doctor</h3>
            <p>
                The standard of Swiss healthcare is very high and ranked as the third best health system in the world.
                Foreign residents or tourists wanting to visit a doctor in Switzerland will typically need some form of
                insurance coverage. Those from the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA) in
                Switzerland on a stay of less than three months can use their <span class="gentle-bold">European Health
                Insurance Card</span> (EHIC) to cover some of the costs. <a class="source"
