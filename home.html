                Culturally vibrant, efficiently run and attractively set at the meeting of river and lake, Zürich is
                regularly recognised as one of the world's most liveable cities. Long known as a savvy, hard-working
                financial centre, Switzerland's largest and wealthiest metropolis has also emerged in the
                21<sup>st</sup> century as one of Central Europe's hippest destinations, with an artsy, post-industrial 
                edge that is epitomised in its exuberant summer Street Parade. <a class="source"

                Despite it not being the administrative capital of any more than its <span class="italic">Kanton</span>, 
                Zürich punches well above its weight in terms of major media and business headquarters and due to it 
                being at the heart of Switzerland's excessively punctual and meticulously maintained train network and 
                being home to Switzerland's most important airport, it is often the first part of Switzerland that visitors 
                get to see. Zürich is close to some excellent skiing resorts and many people headed for the Swiss Alps
                don't spend much time in Zürich itself, but you'd be missing a lot if you don't stay in Zürich for a
                couple of days at least.

                While Zürich can be expensive, it is also clean, efficient and blessed with a high standard of
                living, which together with the high wages, explains why people bear with the high prices. Zürich has 
                drawn people from the rest of Switzerland for centuries, but in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup>
                century it has also begun to draw both people and companies from outside Switzerland and in some cases 
                even outside Europe. This means that you will hear a lot more languages than just Swiss German and the 
                overall atmosphere is a lot more cosmopolitan than you might think. <a class="source"

                    <h4>A great weekend destination</h4>
                    <p>
                        Zürich is a great weekend destination if you live in Western Europe – especially when the weather
                        is not too cold. In 2 days, we saw world class art, rode boats along the river and onto the
                        lake, saw the famous protestant churches Zürich is famous for, and were treated to the exquisite
                        treat of a fiery sunset off one side of Üetliberg mountain and the reflection of the almost
                        full moon on the Zürich See on the other side! <a class="source"

                    <p>
                        I was able to spend 3 wonderful days in Zürich. The city is absolutely beautiful and
                        walking-friendly. The views of the mountains are breathtaking, and there are adorable cafes to
                        grab a bite to eat and enjoy a delicious cappuccino. There are also lovely specialty stores to
                        get unique souvenirs. One such shop sold different liquors and wines out of barrels in which you
                        filled your own glass bottle. <a class="source"
